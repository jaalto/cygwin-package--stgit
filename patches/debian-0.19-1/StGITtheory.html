The nodes are commit IDs stored in the GIT object database. The actual patch is the diff between the trees corresponding to the bottom and the top nodes. This can be written as</p><pre class="real">P = diff(Nb, Nt)

P  - patch
Nb - bottom (start) node
Nt - top (end) node
</pre><p>The order of diff arguments is (old, new).</p><p>For an ordered stack of patches:</p><pre class="real">P1 = diff(N0, N1)
P2 = diff(N1, N2)
...

Ps = P1 + P2 + P3 + ... = diff(Nsb, Nst)

Ps  - the cumulative patch of the whole stack
Nsb - bottom stack node (same as N0)
Nst - top stack node (same as Nn)
</pre><p>The plus sign presents superposition of patches. Please note that such superposition is not always commutative.</p><p>Whenever <a class="local" href="/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi/StGIT">StGIT</a> pulls changes from another repository, it unapplies (pops) all applied patches, updates the branch using git commands and tries to re-apply (push) the patches that were applied.</p><p>Popping a patch from the stack is done by simply setting the stack top Nst to the patch bottom Nb. Pushing is not always trivial and may need merging.</p><p>When pushing an unapplied patch P from the stack, it may happen that the patch bottom Nb is different from the stack top Nst, i.e. the patch was originally applied to a different tree. In this case, the patch needs to be adjusted to its new position on the stack. First, the new stack top is calculated by diff3 merging:</p><pre class="real">Nst' = diff3(Nst, Nb, Nt)
</pre><p>The order of diff3 parameters is (branch1, ancestor, branch2).</p><p>If the merge succeeds, the patch is adjusted as following:</p><pre class="real">Nb' = Nst
Nt' = Nst'
P'  = diff(Nb', Nt')
</pre><p>Nb' and Nt' become the new bottom and top nodes of the patch, and the stack top is advanced to Nst'.</p><p>If the the merge fails, the user is requested to resolve conflicts and refresh the patch by "stg refresh". It is also possible to undo the failed push by "stg push --undo".</p><p>This approach allows easy reordering of patches. To reorder applied patches, the user should pop them first and then push them back to the stack in the desired order. Unless the patches modify the same or adjacent lines in the same files, <a class="local" href="/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi/StGIT">StGIT</a> should be able to adjust the patches automatically for the new order.</p><h2>Layout of the .git Directory</h2><pre class="real">branches/		remote branches to pull (deprecated)
